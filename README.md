# Mechanical Nutcracker (DIN/ISO Standard)
This project is a precision-engineered mechanical nutcracker. It consists of six primary components made of metal and plastic, designed to work together in a lever-actuated mechanism to crack nuts efficiently and reliably. The design follows German DIN and international ISO standards, indicating professional manufacturing and assembly standards.

Parts & Components
1. Grundplatte (Base Plate)
Material: S235Jr (structural steel)

Dimensions: 60 × 12 × 123 mm

Function: Serves as the foundation of the nutcracker. All other components are mounted to or aligned with this plate.

Details:

Contains M4 threaded holes (which must be pre-drilled after assembly)

Corner edges are beveled (45°)

Surface finish: Rz25

2. Standschiene (Support Rail)
Material: PVC hard plastic

Dimensions: 10 × 10 × 122 mm (rectangular profile)

Function: Acts as a vertical or angled guide/support structure for the lever and moving parts.

Details:

Features through-holes to be aligned and drilled together with the base plate

Finished surface with Rz25, sharp edges

3. Lagerbock (Bearing Block)
Material: S235Jr steel

Dimensions: 20 × 35 × 42 mm

Function: Holds and guides the pivot pin (Bolzen) in place, supporting the rotating motion of the lever.

Details:

Precision-machined for fit and tolerance

Tapped holes and diameter-controlled bores for alignment and secure fitting

4. Aufnahmepfanne (Receptacle Pan)
Material: AlMgSi01 (Aluminum-Silicon alloy)

Dimensions: 20 × 20 × 67 mm

Function: Holds the nut to be cracked in a fixed and central position.

Details:

Includes precise stepped bores and counterbores

Beveled edges for safety and fit

Surface finish Rz25

5. Hebel (Lever Arm)
Material: S235Jr

Dimensions: 20 × 20 × 162 mm

Function: Acts as the main force applicator. When pressed down by the user, it applies torque via the pivot (Bolzen) to crack the nut.

Details:

Multiple radii and chamfers to ensure smooth motion

Central bore aligned with the pin (Bolzen)

Surface preparation per DIN 332-A standard for recesses and tapers

6. Bolzen (Pin)
Material: CuZn42 (brass alloy)

Dimensions: Ø12 mm × 48 mm

Function: Serves as the rotational axis (pivot) for the lever.

Details:

Turned to tight tolerances

Slight press-fit design to avoid slippage

Brass used for corrosion resistance and wear reduction

Functionality
This nutcracker uses a lever mechanism:

The nut is placed in the receptacle pan (Aufnahmepfanne).

The lever (Hebel), mounted on the pivot (Bolzen) through the bearing block (Lagerbock), is pressed down.

The force from the lever translates into downward pressure on the nut.

The base plate and support rails hold everything securely to resist deformation under pressure.

Standards Used
DIN 6784 – Workpiece edges (for chamfering and edge quality)

ISO 2768-m – General tolerances, medium class

DIN ISO 1302 – Surface roughness (e.g., Rz25)

DIN 332-A – Drilling standards for cone and hole preparation

 Purpose of the Project
This project demonstrates:
Application of mechanical design principles
Proper use of CAD drawing standards
Material selection based on mechanical properties
Knowledge of manufacturing constraints (drilling, tolerance, assembly)
Familiarity with ISO/DIN documentation
It could serve as a student project, apprentice exam, or technical training example in precision part manufacturing or mechanical design.
